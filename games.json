You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.<br/><br/>Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.<br/><br/>While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.<br/><br/>"}, {"name": "Love Letter", "year": "2012", "rank": "285", "url": "/boardgame/129622/love-letter", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__micro/img/Qiu0VH-5VxmCUkISsvN5-dRlrKw=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic1401448.jpg", "game_id": "129622", "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_play_time": 20, "max_play_time": 20, "play_time": 20, "publisher": "Alderac Entertainment Group", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__original/img/xIAzJY7rl-mtPStRZSqnTVsAr8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1401448.jpg", "description": "All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest.

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.<br/><br/>This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.<br/><br/>From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way.

Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.<br/><br/>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.<br/><br/>A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>"}, {"name": "Above and Below", "year": "2015", "rank": "256", "url": "/boardgame/172818/above-and-below", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__micro/img/FNt-19TVLHdehdXPXLpP6ch7M-U=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic2398773.jpg", "game_id": "172818", "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_play_time": 90, "max_play_time": 90, "play_time": 90, "publisher": "Red Raven Games", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__original/img/gIlpowYQ7XzumYO0jZyVldxosBA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2398773.jpg", "description": "Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.<br/><br/>Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.<br/><br/>With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.<br/><br/>Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?<br/><br/>A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!<br/><br/>The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:<br/><br/>     Villager Tool tokens<br/>     Lost Villagers<br/>     Swamp Villagers<br/>     Exclusive Stretch goals:<br/>     Creature Villagers<br/>     Quest Tokens<br/>     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book<br/>     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book <br/>     Wooden Goods<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives<br/><br/>"}, {"name": "Survive  Escape from Atlantis", "year": "1982", "rank": "287", "url": "/boardgame/2653/survive-escape-atlantis", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0M2ck50-GanxBWfOHUZ64A__micro/img/2baP3_Bis1a9JJlMUKJQH4G1xu8=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic1300182.png", "game_id": "2653", "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_play_time": 45, "max_play_time": 60, "play_time": 60, "publisher": "Parker Brothers", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0M2ck50-GanxBWfOHUZ64A__original/img/5VKS6zuDQlHBQcTcDNRNFYu-7Bg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1300182.png", "description": "Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.<br/><br/>An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board).

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.<br/><br/>Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.<br/><br/>If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.<br/><br/>The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.<br/><br/>"}, {"name": "Welcome Back to the Dungeon", "year": "2016", "rank": "1319", "url": "/boardgame/195043/welcome-back-dungeon", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tu5hFjeX1-5EwnwjdNTaHg__micro/img/lbk5pH2bmvjtJAIaisGxsQLcbrA=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic3060124.jpg", "game_id": "195043", "min_players": 2, "max_players": 4, "min_play_time": 30, "max_play_time": 30, "play_time": 30, "publisher": "2 Pionki", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tu5hFjeX1-5EwnwjdNTaHg__original/img/V0R6BWwAtKsGrfLHDIhsN0claJY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3060124.jpg", "description": "The sun is shining in the Abysmal Woods where you&rsquo;re strolling without a care in the world, your weapon at your belt, dreams of adventure in your head.
